    <h2>What is Pronto?</h2>

    Pronto is a free service that connects hungry groups of people with nearby restaurants that want to accomodate.

    <h2>Why use Pronto?</h2>
    When you're with a group of people looking for food, it can be difficult to find a place last minute that can accomodate. With Pronto, you can contact all participating nearby restaurants at the same time. You will get real time responses from restaurants who can accomodate along with any deals or discounts they may be offering.
